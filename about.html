    In India there is an increase in the magnitude of digitization of healthcare services in various healthcare
    delievery institutions. It has been
    claimed by practitioners and clinicians that electronic  health records have the ability to enhance quality and
    safety of care  besides
    improved management of health information and clinical data. Electronic health records also increase portability of
    clinical information
    of an individual.
    Further, the clinical data resides in silos and usually, access of this data is not extended to the patients, who
    often struggle with paper based record keeping. Today, with the growing trend of a citizen  centric healthcare system
    from an institution centric healthcare system. To bring about this shift, we have created a platform,
        Medi-Vault, which allows Doctors to handle the
    records of their patients. Patients can also take record of their healh problems and medicines.</b>
